## Documentation

Please refer to the [PKSM wiki](https://github.com/FlagBrew/PKSM/wiki) for
detailed documentation.

## Installation

This software works on CFW and Rosalina-based Homebrew Launchers. An internet
connection is required when first launching PKSM.

|  Entrypoint  | Instructions                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :----------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     CFW      | Install the `PKSM.cia` file provided in the release page with your favourite installer. You can now launch the application from the Home Menu                                    |
| Rosalina HBL | Copy the `PKSM.3dsx` file provided in the release page into your SD card. You can now launch PKSM from a [Rosalina-based Homebrew Launcher](https://github.com/fincs/new-hbmenu) |

Initial launch will require your system to be connected to the internet. This is
needed to download the additional assets required for the application to launch.
If your system is not connected to the internet, PKSM will close.
